!! Conclusion

SmaCC is a really strong and stable library that is used in production for many years.
It is an essential asset for dealing with languages.
While PetitParser (See Deep into Pharo *http://books.pharo.org*) is useful for composing and reusing fragments of parsers, Smacc offers speed and more traditional parsing technology.
